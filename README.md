# Digitization

The description here says the gist of what this repository is about, but to expand on that some: Over time I have become increasingly interested in digitizing and storing my family's photos, VHS tapes, 8MM video tapes, cassette tapes, and so on. What follows is a reference for myself (and anyone else who'd like to work similarly). _Side note: I'm open to suggestions here! Please leave a comment or make a pull request if you've an idea of how this could be made more efficient!_

I've broken up my (work in progress) process into a few parts:

## Preparation

## Digitization

### Photos

### VHSes

### Cassettes

### Records

## Storing

Storing the media, physical or digital, should generally be tidy, accessible, and have the future in mind (more on that soon).

### Physical

### Digital

## Other Resources

### Great Courses & Guides
