# Digitization

The description here says the gist of what this repository is about, but to expand on that some: Over time I have become increasingly interested in digitizing and storing my family's photos, VHS tapes, 8MM video tapes, cassette tapes, and so on. What follows is a reference for myself (and anyone else who'd like to work similarly). _Side note: I'm open to suggestions here! Please leave a comment or make a pull request if you've an idea of how this could be made more efficient!_

I've broken up my (work in progress) process into a few parts:

## Preparation

## Digitization

### Photos

- Digitizing Photos
- Removing duplicates

### VHSes

- Digitizing VHSes
- Editing Digitized Video
- For recordings of what was live television, it's likely that recordings already exist on the web. Try a quick search from your search engine and streaming services of choice

### Cassettes

- Digitizing Cassettes
- Editing Digitized Audio

### Records

## Storing

Storing the media, physical or digital, should generally be tidy, accessible, and have the future in mind (more on that soon)

### Physical

### Digital
